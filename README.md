# todo-app
## An assignment given me by a great tech mentor. I had to do research and it felt rewarding :)

• I hosted the Font Awesome CSS package locally to get fancy icons for the project


• You only need to run the Live Server if you are working with VS Code to see the result on the browser


• You are able to add a task


• You are able to delete a task


• You are updated with the total number of tasks left as you add or delete


• You can clear all tasks at once


• Refreshing the page does not wipe data because of local storage
